## LOOKAHEAD
> $LOOKHEAD(A\rightarrow \alpha)::=$ the set of terminals which can be generated by $\alpha$ and if $\alpha \Rightarrow^* \epsilon$, then $FOLLOW(A)$ is added to the set. $$LOOKAHEAD(A\rightarrow\alpha) = FIRST(\{\omega \;|\;S\Rightarrow^*\mu A\beta \Rightarrow \mu \alpha\beta \Rightarrow^* \mu\omega \in V_T^*\})$$Computing formula: $$LOOKAHEAD(A\rightarrow X_1X_2...X_n) = FIRST(X_1X_2...X_n) \oplus FOLLOW(A)$$(It has the same meaning of [[LL Condition#LL condition]])

## Efficient Computaion of LOOKAHAED Sets
> $$LA(p, \; [\alpha.\beta])=\{a\; | \; a \in FIRST(\delta), \; S'\Rightarrow^*\gamma A\delta \Rightarrow \gamma\alpha\beta\delta, \; \gamma\alpha \; accesses \; p \}$$$\gamma\alpha \; accesses \; p$ means that starting from the start state the scanning of the string $\gamma\alpha$ with result in a sequence of state transitions, the last of which is state p.
